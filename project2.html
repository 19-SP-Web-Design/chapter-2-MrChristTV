    <h1>A favorite quote of mine</h1>
    <hr>
   <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/deep-thoughts">
   <pre>â€¦the sad part is, that I will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than I loved you when I knew you.
Some people might find that strange.
But the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person, is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them.</pre>

   <p>This particular quote speaks to me in <strong> bold </strong> words. The person who wrote it or came up with the quote is <em>Ranata Suzuki</em>,
   I am not sure who she is but the quote does appear to have elements of a broken or a recently repaired soul.</p>
